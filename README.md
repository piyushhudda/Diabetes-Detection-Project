## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project leverages machine learning to analyze patient data and predict the presence of diabetes, potentially aiding in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 768 samples and 8 features including:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diabetes-Detection-Project.git
    cd Diabetes-Detection-Project
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. To preprocess the data and train the model, run:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

2. To evaluate the model on the test set, run:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

3. To make predictions on new data, run:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input data/new_patient_data.csv
    ```

## Model Training

The model training process involves the following steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Model Selection: Testing multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model parameters.
- Training: Fitting the selected model on the training data.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Results and performance metrics are displayed after running the evaluation script.
